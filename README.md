##Assumptions
- When multiple pricing rules are defined, the last one defined wins
- The prices can be input at every round of checkout
- The program must be run again in order to have a different cart (i.e. cart items are defined as input into program)
- The prices can be input from a json file with my own specification (as defined schema was a string which changed throughout document)
